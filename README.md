This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP involving null comparisons. The `bug.php` file shows the incorrect comparison using the loose comparison operator (`==`), which can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with null values.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides the corrected code, using the strict comparison operator (`===`), ensuring accurate null checks.  This is a crucial distinction for developers to understand, preventing potential logic errors in their applications.
